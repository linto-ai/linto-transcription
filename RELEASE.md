# 1.3.0
 - Add input option "language" that can be passed at each request
 - Add result of language detection (or given language) in the output, for each segment
 - Add speaker identification ("speakerIdentification" option in "diarizationConfig")

# 1.2.12
 - Do not fail when asking to convert numbers with env. variable LANGUAGE=*

# 1.2.11
 - Improve heuristics to merge transcription and diarization results (for words in between two speaker turns)

# 1.2.10
 - Add heuristics to avoid too long speech segment sent to STT (limit risk of memory overflow)
 - Fix failure with token "- Et"

# 1.2.9
 - Avoid a 1H timeout that was causing celery task to re-run (and fail)
 - VAD: Improve heuristics about audio segment durations to better adapt to Whisper setting (minDuration=30)
 - Preserve exponents ("Â²") in word normalization

# 1.2.8
 - In full transcription: proper normalization of spaces before/after traditional punctuation marks (for French and English at least)
 - In word normalization: improve distinction of characters (word / punctuation / symbol that can be pronounced / garbage symbol)
 - Fix typo fr_FR -> fr-FR
 - Fix inconsistency in transcription confidence score (now always computed from word confidence scores, not segment confidence scores)

# 1.2.7
 - Remove punctuations in words (to avoid spaces as in "allez-vous ?")

# 1.2.6
 - Fix possible worker conflict when multiple workers are running on the same file
    (the audio file could be deleted by the worker that first finishes)
 - Fix speaker segment splitted in two when diarization detects another speaker with no word assigned.
 - Fix a bug in the formatting progression "status" ("StepState.PENDING" -> "pending"),
    which was introduced because python version was not fixed in Dockerfile (python 3.11 changes behaviour when converting enum to string)

# 1.2.5
 - Add options for VAD (minimum duration of segments, ...)

# 1.2.4
 - Fix corner case of empty transcriptions
 - Fix corner cases to assign words to speaker turns (overlapping diarization segments, words in between two segments)

# 1.2.3
 - Added multifiles route and processing.
 - Changed straddling word diarization resolve
 - Added diarization results within transcription result.

# 1.2.2
 - Added recover to redis search index drop.

# 1.2.1

 - Added Makefile for styling
 - Refactored code to PEP8 (black)
 - Reorganized repository folder structure.
 - Added service discovery for subtasks
 - Added service resolve and service resolve policy
 - Added task logs and log query route
 - Added possibility to upload a timestamps file.
